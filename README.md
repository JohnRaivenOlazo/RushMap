# **Rush Map üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö¶**

**A web app to track pedestrian congestion based on traffic data to help people navigate crowded areas during rush hour.**

### **About The Project**

**Pedestrian Rush Hour Tracker** is a web-based application designed to provide real-time insights into pedestrian congestion, helping individuals avoid crowded areas during peak traffic times. The app leverages real-time traffic data to estimate pedestrian density, offering users a simple, intuitive interface to visualize high-traffic zones and find the quickest paths to their destinations. This tool is perfect for those who want to navigate the city efficiently and avoid the stress of crowded streets during rush hour.

### **Features**
- **Real-Time Traffic Data Integration**: Uses live traffic data from Google Maps API to estimate pedestrian congestion in various areas.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Visualize areas with heavy pedestrian flow using dynamic heatmaps, helping users easily identify crowded zones.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, clean, and intuitive UI for quick navigation and easy access to traffic and congestion data.
- **Route Recommendations**: Provides alternative routes to avoid high-congestion areas and find the quickest paths during rush hour.
- **Live Updates**: Continuous updates on traffic and pedestrian conditions in real-time.

### **How It Works**

1. **Traffic Data Collection**:
   The app fetches real-time traffic data from the **Google Maps API**, which includes information about traffic flow, speed, and congestion in various areas.
   
2. **Estimating Pedestrian Congestion**:
   Based on traffic data, the app estimates pedestrian congestion in real-time. Heavy traffic flow is used as a proxy for high pedestrian density, helping users avoid crowded areas.

3. **Visualization**:
   The app uses **Leaflet.js** to display the traffic and congestion data on a map with heatmap overlays, clearly showing which areas are most crowded.

4. **Route Planning**:
   By using the congestion data, the app suggests alternative routes for pedestrians to avoid congested zones and reach their destinations more efficiently.
